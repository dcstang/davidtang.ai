# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a personal landing page for David Tang built as a containerized Go application serving a static Svelte website. The application is designed for deployment on Google Cloud Run Gen 1.

## Architecture

- **Backend**: Go HTTP server (`main.go`) that serves static files from the `dist` directory
- **Frontend**: Svelte application with Tailwind CSS for styling
- **Build Process**: Multi-stage Docker build that compiles both Svelte frontend and Go backend
- **Deployment**: Google Cloud Run with Container Registry

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

# Start development server (Svelte only)
npm run dev

# Build Svelte application for production
npm run build

# Test Go server locally (requires built dist folder)
go run main.go

# Build Docker image locally
docker build -t davidtang-ai .

# Run container locally
docker run -p 8080:8080 davidtang-ai
```

## Deployment

### Manual Deployment
1. Update `PROJECT_ID` in `deploy.sh`
2. Run: `./deploy.sh`

### Automated Deployment (Cloud Build)
1. Set up Cloud Build trigger pointing to this repository
2. Cloud Build will use `cloudbuild.yaml` for automated deployment

## File Structure

- `main.go` - Go HTTP server that serves static files
- `src/App.svelte` - Main Svelte component with under construction page
- `src/main.js` - Svelte application entry point
- `src/app.css` - Tailwind CSS imports
- `dist/` - Built Svelte application (generated by `npm run build`)
- `Dockerfile` - Multi-stage build for containerization
- Social links and profile photo are currently placeholders in `src/App.svelte`

## Configuration Notes

- Server runs on port 8080 (required for Cloud Run)
- Cloud Run configuration: 512Mi memory, 1 CPU, max 10 instances
- Application serves from `/dist` directory
- Profile photo and social links need to be updated in `src/App.svelte`
